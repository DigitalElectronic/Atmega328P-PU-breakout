# Atmega328P-PU-breakout
Breakout Chip for the Atmega328P-PU

This is a breakout board for the Atmega328 chip with an external 16 Mhz crystal. You can plug a 9v battery into it as well. It also includes a power switch and a few LEDS. You can program the chip using the ICSP pins and using a programmer (like the USBTinyISP). This was my attempt of recreating my own Arduino Uno. 

Includes:
  - Pinheaders
  - 16Mhz Crystal
  - 5V regulator 
  - Power switch
  - ICSP pins
 
What I learned:
  - How to use a crystal
  - Programming/working with Atmega328P-PU and Atmega238P
